			<h3>Hello, so I figured I should introduce myself first so.</h3>
			<p>Iam Fernando, ate the moment I'm 27 years young. So I was quite lost about what I could do of my life. As at the momment Iam working as a painter and do not like my job very much. Anyways, I'm stuck at it as I still need to work with that for another couple of years, so I can reach a <em>personal goal.</em><br>

			<p>I like a lot outside activities, going to the beach, waterfalls, dining out in different restaurants, trying new kinds of cookery, traveling to different places, doing new activities, drinking with friends. I like also to be inside, but that is not something we like to talk about.<br>

			<h2> Why did I Start Studying Front End Development?</h2>
			<p> So I have been looking for something I would like doing for a while now. Tried uni, gave up 3 of them. Tried studying finances, was not very much me. And now on my last holiday I was talking to a friend, and he is a Web Developer. <em>Kaleb</em> told me about the field and got me curious. I had programmed robots before, not that this is related but. Anyway, thought about studying back end at firts, but them on another conversation with this friend of mine I decided to give <strong>front end</strong> a try. So far I like it a lot, it got me studying in a way a have never done before. I hope a keep liking it, even when it get dificult. <em>Wanna learn it so I also can be close to my family, the one me and my fiance are going to have, and to make some money also.</em><br>
